#| Note [Tabs and tab stops]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The CommonMark spec mandates that tabs be left alone when they appear inside
block content, but they must be treated specially when they appear in
indentation used to define block structure. Such tabs are interpreted as if they
were replaced by spaces up to the nearest tab stop, where each tab stop has a
width of four spaces.

Note that this does NOT mean a tab character is always interpreted as four
spaces. A tab can have a width of 1, 2, 3, or 4 spaces depending on the width of
the line up to that point. For example, all five of the following lines have
identical amounts of logical indentation, namely four spaces worth (where ‘.’
represents a space and ‘→’ represents a tab):

    ....a
    ...→b
    ..→c
    .→d
    →e

The placement of tab stops is absolute and is not altered by any nested block
structure. For example, in the document

    >.→hello

the inner tab has a width of two spaces, not four, so the blockquote contains a
paragraph, not an indented code block. This is something of a departure from
other aspects of the spec, which generally treats contexts inside a container
block identically to how they would be treated if the container were removed,
but it makes sense given that the special treatment of tabs is designed to
accommodate the way tabs are rendered in text editors, which do not know
anything about markdown document structure.

Handling this properly requires keeping track of two additional pieces of state:

  1. The `tab-stop-offset` variable keeps track of the current column modulo 4,
     which is used to determine the width of tabs when they’re encountered.

  2. The `partially-consumed-tab?` variable is set to #t after encountering a
     tab in a context that consumes fewer spaces worth of indentation than the
     tab expands to. For example, consider the following document:

         -.foo

         →..bar

     When the parser encounters the third line, it must consume two spaces worth
     of indentation to enter the open list item. However, the line starts with a
     four-space tab, which leaves two spaces unconsumed. To record this fact,
     `tab-stop-offset` is set to 2 and `partially-consumed-tab?` is set to #t,
     which means 2 spaces in the current tab remain before reaching the next tab
     stop. These can then be combined with the two additional spaces to parse
     the four-space indent required to start an indented code block.

Most of the parser does not need to worry about this tricky column tracking, as
spaces are treated uniformly once all blocks have been entered. However, many
blocks may be prefixed with “optional indentation” of up to three spaces, which
must be tab-aware, see Note [Optional indentation] for more details.

Note [Optional indentation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As described in Note [Tabs and tab stops], tabs must be treated with care when
parsing block structure. Generally, that structure is only relevant when parsing
container blocks, as tabs inside leaf blocks have no special meaning. However,
most leaf blocks may be optionally prefixed with up to three spaces of
indentation, and that indentation must be tab-aware. (Why up to three spaces?
Because four or more spaces of indentation would form an indented code block.)

To handle this optional indentation uniformly, we define a few helper functions:

  * The `regexp-try/opt-indent` and `regexp-peek/opt-indent` functions are like
    `regexp-try-match` and `regexp-match-peek`, respectively, but they attempt
    to consume an optional indent before matching the regular expression. If
    more than three spaces worth of indentation are present, they return #f.

  * The `read-line/opt-indent` function is used only when parsing the body of a
    fenced code block, which has somewhat unusual parsing rules. The entire line
    is unconditionally consumed, regardless of the number of spaces of
    indentation, but the amount of optional identation is returned as well, as
    some portion of it may be incorporated into the line (depending on the
    amount of indentation used by the opening fence).

Note [Lists overview]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lists are by far the subtlest part of CommonMark to get right, as they have lots
of special cases. CommonMark specifies lists in terms of two separate types of
container block: lists and list items. However, this is awkward to implement, as
a list is simply defined as a sequence of list items, so the lifecycle of a list
container is necessarily tied to the lifecycle of its constituent items.

We therefore unify open lists and open list items into a single structure,
`o:list`, which almost always represents an open list item that happens to have
a set of earlier list items recorded alongside it. The one exception is a very
unusual special case, see Note [Open lists without an open item].

Note [Entering open lists]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since an `o:list` structure represents both an open list and an open list item,
“entering” an open list can actually involve one of two different things:

  1. In the simple case, the currently-open list item remains open, so we enter
     the `o:list` container as usual.

  2. In the less simple case, we might need to close the currently-open list
     item and start a new one, in which case `try-enter-container` must handle
     closing the previous list item and updating the `o:list` structure before
     it can be entered.

This is a bit aesthetically unsatisfying, since it would be nice if
`try-enter-container` were guaranteed to do nothing except consume the
container’s start-of-line prefix, but this allows us to preserve the invariant
that `add-block!` can always add any type of block to the innermost open
container, rather than having to worry about closing an open list if a non-list
item block is added to it.

Note [Open lists without an open item]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As discussed in Note [Lists overview], an `o:list` container almost always
represents an open list item, since it’s almost impossible to end up in a
parser state where a list container remains open even though the most recent
list item has been closed. The only exception stems from the rule that a list
item may not begin with two blank lines:

> A list item can begin with at most one blank line. In the following example,
> `foo` is not part of the list item:
>
>     -     | <ul>
>           | <li></li>
>     ..foo | </ul>
>           | <p>foo</p>

This necessitates two features of the `o:list` structure:

  1. The `blocks` field can be #f, which means “no open list item”.

  2. The `start-blank?` field tracks whether or not a starting blank line has
     already been seen, in which case a second blank line must close the open
     list item.

Importantly, `blocks` can never be #f at the beginning of `mode:content-start`,
since `try-enter-container` will not enter an `o:list` container unless it can
enter an already-open list item or it can start a new list item (see
Note [Entering open lists]).

Note [Open list tightness]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Determining whether a list is tight or loose is awkward: a list is generally
loose if it contains any blank lines, but blank lines that occur at the start of
a list item or at the end of the list don’t count. Ignoring blank lines at the
start of a list item is easy, but ignoring blank lines at the end of the list is
harder, because we don’t know whether or not the list will have more blocks
until we read more lines.

To avoid having to do arbitrary amounts of lookahead, we store whether or not an
open list ends in a blank line in the `end-blank?` field of an `o:list`
structure. Whenever a new block is added to an open list, we set `style` to
'loose if `end-blank?` is #t and reset `end-blank?` to #f. Even though the value
of `end-blank?` is no longer relevant for determining the style of the current
open list, it’s still important to track it accurately, as it may affect the
style of /enclosing/ lists; see Note [Transfer `end-blank?` to parent lists].

Note [Transfer `end-blank?` to parent lists]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following markdown input:

    * foo
      * bar

      baz

The inner list should be tight, and the outer list should be loose. But if we
aren’t careful, the strategy described in Note [Open list tightness] will miss
that the outer list is loose, since the blank line will set `end-blank?` on the
inner list, not the outer one. Therefore, to ensure the outer list is properly
marked loose, we must transfer the value of `end-blank?` to any immediately-
enclosing parent list whenever a list is closed.

Note that it is critical that we perform this transfer /after/ we’ve already
added the child list to the parent. If we transferred `end-blank?` to the parent
/before/ adding the child list, we’d accidentally interpret

    * foo⏎
      * bar⏎
    ⏎

essentially as if it were

    * foo⏎
    ⏎
      * bar⏎

which would result in the outer list incorrectly being marked loose with no
trailing newline. (This may seem obvious, but we previously got this wrong; see
GitHub issue #5.)

One might wonder whether it’s safe to only do this transferring to immediately-
enclosing lists, as there could be a blockquote in the way:

    * foo
      > * bar
      >
      baz

Should the outer list still be loose even though the blank line is contained
within a blockquote? Fortunately, the answer is /no/. The spec says

> A list is loose if any of its constituent list items are separated by blank
> lines, or if any of its constituent list items directly contain two block-
> level elements with a blank line between them.

which makes it clear that the blank line must appear between two direct children
of the list item. |#
